# RemoteSwitch

# Overview
This project is aimed at creating and I2C based remote switch system. The idea
behind this is to have less power wires running to different devices by having
a larger set of power cables going to a remote switching unit. The devices are
much closer to the switch unit, and will be powered from it.

# Ideal Use Case
I came up with this idea to be able to use it in my vehicle for running LED
lights. This means an area of lights can be controlled by a single unit, such
that a unit can have 4 or 8 switch-able circuits per unit. This would solve a
major problem of running less wires through a firewall.

Using I2C vs just having small trigger wires would mean that multiple units can
be added to the same bus, and down the line, more complicated logic such as
voltage and current sensor can be installed.
